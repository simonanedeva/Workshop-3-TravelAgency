# OOP Workshop - Travel Agency

## Preface

Before you start coding, read this document from top to bottom. It has some valuable information that will make your work easier.

## Description

Implement a journey and ticket tracking system for a famous travel agency called `Sunny Travel`. The application already accepts commands and outputs text for each submitted command. The user can create different models (`Bus, Airplane, Train, Ticket, Journey`) and list them. What you need to do is build the OO classes hierarchy. Make sure to follow the object-oriented programming best practices and conventions discussed during the lectures.

## Architecture

By now you should be aware of how the `Engine` works. It's the same as all previous workshops. The commands use the `AgencyRepositoryImpl` class to create and store all the application information. After a command is executed, it returns a result message to the `EngineImpl` and the engine prints it to the console.

Your focus should be on the **models** and **commands** packages. In **models** you must place the classes you create using the provided interfaces in the **contracts** package. In**commands** you must implement the commands which are not ready yet.

## Models

> Note: All validation intervals are inclusive (closed).

### **Train**

- `passenger capacity` - a number between `30` and `150`.
 - Exception message: `A train cannot have less than 30 passengers or more than 150 passengers.`
- `price per kilometer` - a number between `0.1` and `2.5` representing currency.
- `Type` - one of `[Land, Air, Sea]`.
- `carts` - a number between `1` and `15`.
 - Exception message: `A train cannot have less than 1 cart or more than 15 carts.`
- Should be convertible to **String** in the format:

```none
Train ----
Passenger capacity: {capacity}
Price per kilometer: {pricePerKilometer}
Vehicle type: {vehicleType}
Carts amount: {carts}
```

### **Airplane**

- `passenger capacity` - a number.
- `price per kilometer` - a number.
- `Type` - one of `[Land, Air, Sea]`.
- `has free food` - boolean.
- Should be convertible to **String** in the format:

```none
Airplane ----
Passenger capacity: {capacity}
Price per kilometer: {pricePerKilometer}
Vehicle type: {vehicleType}
Has free food: {hasFreeFood}
```

### **Bus**

- `passenger capacity` - a number between `10` and `50`.
 - Exception message: `A bus cannot have less than 10 passengers or more than 50 passengers.`
- `price per kilometer` - a number.
- `Type` - one of `[Land, Air, Sea]`.
- Should be convertible to **String** in the format:

```none
Bus ----
Passenger capacity: {capacity}
Price per kilometer: {pricePerKilometer}
Vehicle type: {vehicleType}
```

### **Journey**

- `start location` - a string with lengths between `5` and `25` symbols.
 - Exception message: `The StartingLocation's length cannot be less than 5 or more than 25 symbols long.`
- `destination` - a string with lengths between `5` and `25` symbols.
 - Exception message: `The Destination's length cannot be less than 5 or more than 25 symbols long.`
- `distance` - a number between `5` and `5000`.
 - Exception message: `The Distance cannot be less than 5 or more than 5000 kilometers.`
- `Vehicle` - the vehicle used in the journey.
- `calculateTravelCosts()` - calculated by multiplying the `distance` by the `Vehicle`'s `price per kilometer`.
- Should be convertible to **String** in the format:

```none
Journey ----
Start location: {startLocation}
Destination: {destination}
Distance: {distance}
Vehicle type: {vehicleType}
Travel costs: {costs}
```

### **Ticket**

- `Journey` - the journey the ticket is sold for.
- `administrative costs` - a number.
- `calculatePrice()` - calculated by multiplying the `administrative costs` by the `Journey`'s `travel costs`.
- Should be convertible to **String** in the format:

```none
Ticket ----
Destination: {destination}
Price: {price}
```

### **Additional validations**

The laws of physics and finances dictate that:

- A vehicle with **less than 1** or **more than 800 passengers** cannot exist!
 - Exception message: `A vehicle with less than 1 passenger or more than 800 passengers cannot exist!`
- A vehicle with a price per kilometer **lower than $0.10** or **higher than $2.50** cannot exist!
 - Exception message: `A vehicle with a price per kilometer lower than $0.10 or higher than $2.50 cannot exist!`

There is no such vehicle in your case but think about these rules more generally. This system could be extended in the future to accommodate more vehicles.

## Repository

The `AgencyRepositoryImpl` class is used to store and retrieve all the information that the application needs. It is also in charge of creating the objects.

The class has a private `nextId` field that stores the following `ID` to be assigned. 

Your task is to implement all methods that throw `UnsupportedOperationException`.

## Commands

**All commands are case insensitive, except for their parameters!** Each command is represented in the code base as a separate class invoked by the `CommandFactoryImpl`.

You are given a set of commands. The following are already implemented:

- **CreateBus** `[passengerCapacity] [pricePerKilometer]` - creates a new `Bus`.
- **CreateTrain** `[passengerCapacity] [pricePerKilometer] [carts]` - creates a new `Train`.
- **CreateJourney** `[startLocation] [destination] [distance] [vehicleID]` - creates a new `Journey`.
- **ListJourneys** - lists all stored journeys.
- **ListTickets** - lists all stored tickets.

And these are the commands you need to implement yourself:

- **CreateAirplane** `[passengerCapacity] [pricePerKilometer] [hasFreeFood]` - creates a new `Airplane`.
- **CreateTicket** `[journeyID] [administrativeCosts]` - creates a new `Ticket`.
- **ListVehicles** - lists all stored vehicles.

## Constraints

- You can create new and modify existing **classes, interfaces, enumerations, and packages** in the **models** package.
- You are allowed to modify the `AgencyRepositoryImpl`.
- You can create and modify existing classes in the **commands** package.
- ***You are NOT allowed to modify any other existing interfaces!***
- ***You are NOT allowed to modify any other existing classes, enumerations, and packages!***

## Unit Tests

- You have been given unit tests to keep track of your progress. Run them by right-clicking the **tests** package and selecting **Run 'All Tests'**.
- If you get stuck, check out the tests' names to guide you on what to do.
 
> Note: Be careful not to change anything in the **tests** folder.

## Step by step guide

1. If you try to build the Skeleton, it won't compile. Do not worry.
2. Navigate to the **models** package. What would be the hierarchy between the interfaces? Inspect what classes are there and consider what interfaces they need to implement. Is there an opportunity to introduce an abstract class?
3. After implementing and encapsulating the needed models, head to the `AgencyRepositoryImpl` class. All methods that throw `UnsupportedOperationException` need to be implemented.
4. It is now time to implement all commands that are not implemented.

## Advanced tasks (Optional)

> Note: Do not worry about those. Start working on them only if you've completed all the other tasks.

1. The `ticketsToString()`, `vehiclesToString()`, and `journeysToString()` methods look kind of similar. For every list type, there is a method. Can we have one method for all list types? Take a look at `<T extends Printable> String elementsListToString(List<T> elements)` in `ListingHelpers.java`.
1. The `findTicketById()`, `findJourneyById()`, and `findVehicleById()` methods are also similar. They loop over a list of objects and check if any objects have an `ID` equal to the wanted `ID`. Can we use generics to have only one method that goes through a list (no matter what type, as long as it has a `getId()` method) and finds if one of the elements has the target `ID`? You are already given most of the method signature in `AgencyRepositoryImpl.java`, `<T extends {{???}}> T findElementById(List<T> elements, int id);`. What should go in the `{{?}}`?
